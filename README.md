Complaint Management System (CMS) - JSP Project

This is a full-stack web application developed as a prototype for a Municipal IT Division's internal Complaint Management System (CMS). The project is built using Jakarta EE (Servlets, JSP) and follows a strict Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

ï¿½ Project Overview

The primary goal of this system is to provide a platform for internal employees to submit, track, and manage complaints. It features a role-based access system distinguishing between standard Employees and Admins, each with a distinct set of permissions and functionalities. All backend interactions are performed synchronously through standard HTML form submissions (GET/POST), without the use of AJAX or other asynchronous mechanisms.
